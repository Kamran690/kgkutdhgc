    <p>The school system in Pakistan operates under a structured framework but faces challenges. It comprises several levels:

        Pre-primary Education: Includes kindergarten and Montessori education, focusing on early childhood development.
        
        Primary Education: Typically spans Grades 1-5, emphasizing basic literacy, numeracy, and general knowledge.
        
        Middle Education: Covers Grades 6-8, building on foundational knowledge with more subject-specific learning.
        
        Secondary Education: Includes Grades 9-10, leading to the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) or Matriculation exams.
        
        Higher Secondary Education: Encompasses Grades 11-12, culminating in the Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSSC), also called "Intermediate."
        
        Tertiary Education: Offered by universities and colleges, providing undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.
        
        Challenges include unequal access, outdated curricula, lack of infrastructure, and disparities between urban and rural areas. Efforts are ongoing to address these issues and improve the quality of education.</p>

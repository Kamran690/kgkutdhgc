        <H1>THERSTY CROW</H1>
    </Center>
    <p>On a hot summer day, a crow was feeling very thirsty. It had been flying around for a long time, searching for
        water, but had no luck. Finally, after flying over fields and forests, the crow spotted a pitcher of water under
        a tree.

        Excited, the crow flew down to the pitcher. But when it peered inside, it found the water level too low for its
        beak to reach. The crow tried to push its beak into the narrow opening, but it was no use—the water was just out
        of reach.

        The crow thought for a moment, frustrated. But then, it came up with an idea. The clever bird noticed that there
        were some small pebbles scattered around the base of the tree. The crow had an idea: if it could raise the water
        level, it might be able to drink.

        So, the crow began picking up small pebbles one by one and dropping them into the pitcher. Slowly but surely,
        the water began to rise. The crow continued to drop more pebbles, one after the other, until the water level was
        high enough for the crow to drink.

        The crow was able to quench its thirst and flew off, feeling refreshed.

        Moral of the story:

        “Little by little, one can achieve big things.”

        The story teaches us the value of persistence, clever thinking, and using available resources to solve a
        problem. Instead of giving up when it couldn’t reach the water, the crow figured out a creative solution, and in
        the end, it was able to drink.
